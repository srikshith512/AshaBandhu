# ASHA Bandhu - Sync Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Sync Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: ✅ Patients Disappearing After Sync
**Problem**: Sync was replacing all local data with API data, losing unsync patients.

**Solution**: Modified `loadPatients()` to merge data properly:
- Load local data first (always available)
- Fetch from API (if online and authenticated)
- Merge API data with local data
- Preserve `local` and `pending` patients during sync

**File**: `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` (lines 33-92)

---

### Issue 2: ✅ Pending Sync Widget Not Working
**Problem**: Pending sync count wasn't accurate.

**Solution**: 
- Updated widget to show both `pending` + `local` patients
- Added proper `syncPendingPatients()` method
- Drawer shows accurate count and triggers manual sync

**Files**: 
- `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` (lines 186-299)
- `lib/widgets/app_drawer.dart` (lines 168-246)

---

### Issue 3: ✅ Auto-Sync on Add Patient
**Problem**: New patients weren't syncing automatically.

**Solution**:
- New patients marked as `syncStatus = 'local'`
- Auto-sync attempted when adding patient
- If sync fails (offline), remains as `local` for later sync

**File**: `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` (lines 91-133)

---

### Issue 4: ✅ PIN Login Users Can't Sync
**Problem**: PIN login has no auth token, so sync failed.

**Solution**:
- Added `syncWithCredentials()` method
- PIN users get dialog to enter Worker ID + Password
- Temporarily authenticates to get token
- Performs sync with token
- Works for both PIN and Password login users

**Files**:
- `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` (lines 347-382)
- `lib/widgets/app_drawer.dart` (lines 173-246, 340-390)

---

### Issue 5: ✅ Password Login Showing Offline Mode
**Problem**: Auth token wasn't being stored during login/registration.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `ApiService.login()` to store token in SharedPreferences
- Fixed `ApiService.register()` to store token
- Added debug logging to track token storage
- Token check in `loadPatients()` properly detects online mode

**Files**:
- `lib/services/api_service.dart` (lines 60-107)
- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` (lines 49-78, 117-167)
- `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` (lines 55-92)

---

### Issue 6: ✅ Sync Fetches All Patients from Server
**Problem**: Sync only uploaded local patients, didn't fetch from server.

**Solution**:
- `syncPendingPatients()` now does TWO operations:
  1. Upload local/pending patients to server
  2. Fetch ALL patients from server (including from other ASHA workers)
- Merges server data with local data
- Works even if upload fails (still fetches)

**File**: `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` (lines 186-299)

## 🔄 How Sync Works Now

### Scenario 1: Password Login (Online Mode)
```
1. Login with password → Gets auth token
2. Token stored in SharedPreferences
3. Add patient → Marked as 'local', auto-sync attempted
4. loadPatients() → Fetches from API automatically
5. Tap "Pending Sync" → Direct sync, no dialog
6. Result: Uploads + Downloads all patients
```

### Scenario 2: PIN Login (Offline Mode)
```
1. Login with PIN → No token (offline)
2. Add patient → Stored locally as 'local'
3. loadPatients() → Uses local data only
4. Tap "Pending Sync" → Dialog asks for credentials
5. Enter Worker ID + Password → Temporary auth
6. Result: Uploads + Downloads all patients
```

### Scenario 3: Offline → Online Transition
```
1. User offline → Adds 5 patients (all 'local')
2. User comes online → Opens app
3. loadPatients() → No token, uses local data
4. Tap "Pending Sync" → Enter credentials
5. Sync uploads 5 patients + downloads all from server
6. Local DB updated with merged data
```

## 📊 Sync Status Flow

```
New Patient Created
    ↓
syncStatus = 'local'
    ↓
Auto-sync attempted
    ↓
    ├─ Success → syncStatus = 'synced'
    └─ Fail → Remains 'local'
    
Manual Sync Triggered
    ↓
Upload local/pending patients
    ↓
Fetch ALL patients from server
    ↓
Merge with local data
    ↓
Update syncStatus = 'synced'
```

## 🔍 Debug Logging

Console output during sync:

### Successful Password Login:
```
🔐 Attempting API login for: ASHA001
📡 API login response: true
✅ API login successful, token received: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...
✅ Password login complete - online mode enabled
🔍 Token check: Found token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...
✅ Loaded 5 patients (3 from API)
```

### PIN Login (Offline):
```
🔍 Token check: No token found - offline mode
📴 Offline mode (PIN login) - using local data only
✅ Loaded 5 patients (0 from API)
```

### Successful Sync:
```
🔄 Starting sync: 2 pending patients
✅ Uploaded 2 patients, 0 failed
🔄 Fetching all patients from server...
📥 Received 10 patients from server
✅ Sync complete: 2 uploaded, 10 from server, 10 total in DB
```

## 🧪 Testing Sync

### Test 1: Password Login + Sync
```bash
1. Register new user (ASHA002, pass123)
2. Console shows: ✅ Auth token stored
3. Add patient → Auto-syncs
4. Check backend: Patient should exist
5. Login as PHC → Should see patient
```

### Test 2: PIN Login + Manual Sync
```bash
1. Logout, login with PIN
2. Add patient → Stored locally
3. Tap "Pending Sync" → Enter credentials
4. Console shows: 🔄 Fetching all patients...
5. Patient list updates with all patients
```

### Test 3: Offline → Online
```bash
1. Turn off WiFi
2. Login with PIN, add 3 patients
3. Turn on WiFi
4. Tap "Pending Sync" → Enter credentials
5. All 3 patients upload + fetch all from server
```

## 📁 Key Files Modified

### Core Sync Logic
- `lib/providers/patient_provider.dart` - Main sync implementation
- `lib/services/api_service.dart` - API calls and token management
- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Login/registration with token storage

### UI Components
- `lib/widgets/app_drawer.dart` - Pending sync button and credentials dialog
- `lib/screens/asha/asha_home_screen.dart` - Pending sync widget

### Backend
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Returns JWT tokens
- `backend/routes/patients.js` - Patient CRUD + sync endpoint
- `backend/routes/sync.js` - Batch sync endpoint

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Token Storage
- Tokens stored in SharedPreferences (local device only)
- Not encrypted (consider flutter_secure_storage for production)
- Tokens expire after 24h (configurable)

### PIN vs Password
- **PIN**: Offline only, no server authentication
- **Password**: Online, gets JWT token, enables sync

### Sync Authentication
- All sync operations require valid JWT token
- PIN users must provide password to sync
- Tokens validated on backend for every API call

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

### 1. Background Sync
```dart
// Use WorkManager for periodic background sync
WorkManager.registerPeriodicTask(
  "sync-task",
  "syncPatients",
  frequency: Duration(hours: 1),
);
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution
```dart
// Implement CRDT or Last-Write-Wins with timestamps
if (local.updatedAt > server.updatedAt) {
  // Keep local version
} else {
  // Use server version
}
```

### 3. Sync Progress Indicator
```dart
// Show detailed sync progress
StreamBuilder<SyncProgress>(
  stream: syncProvider.syncProgress,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    return LinearProgressIndicator(
      value: snapshot.data?.progress ?? 0,
    );
  },
);
```

### 4. Retry Failed Syncs
```dart
// Exponential backoff for failed syncs
Future<void> retryFailedSyncs() async {
  final failed = patients.where((p) => p.syncStatus == 'failed');
  for (final patient in failed) {
    await _retrySyncWithBackoff(patient);
  }
}
```
